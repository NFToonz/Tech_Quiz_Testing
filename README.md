Summary
This challenge for Module 19 focuses on implementing automated testing using Cypress. The application under test generates randomized tech-related questions, allowing users to select and answer from multiple choices.

As an entry-level QA tester, this project demonstrates practical experience with:

Writing and executing end-to-end tests using Cypress

Verifying core functionalities of a dynamic quiz application

Testing randomized content and ensuring consistent behavior

Validating UI interactions and feedback for user answers

This hands-on experience builds foundational skills in quality assurance and test automation within a JavaScript-based environment.
